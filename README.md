These are my solutions to the problemset of [leetcode.com](leetcode.com).

For every 5 easy problems done, I do 1 medium, and for every 5 medium, I do 1 hard. The problems are solved in order as they appear on the site, and none will be skipped. As a minimum, a solution to a problem must pass all example tests. All problems are solved using Python - and with no use of external libraries/packages unless stated by the problem.

Completed as of 09/21/21:\
Easy: 5\
Medium: 1\
Hard: 0

Disclaimers
---

1. More often than not, the code will be assembled fast, and hence be sloppy.
2. I did not intend the solutions to be optimal in any way - they may even contain bugs.
3. Although I try to adhere to the problem descriptions, I will look to cut corners.
